[dependencies]
jecs = "ukendio/jecs@0.4.0" # 0.5 uses type functions, and therefore the new solver
# unfortunately, supporting the new type solver would mean a full rewrite or hacky workarounds to make it happy at the moment -
# - it's not great on existing projects
# i'll update it once it matures a bit more
